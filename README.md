#  Web Scraping and Interactive Visualization with Shiny for Child Mortality


## Project Description

In this  project, we scraped data from the World Bank and created an interactive Shiny application on Child Mortality data. This project is mixture of the web scraping techniques and interactive visualization.

**Objectives:**

1.  **Web Scraping**: We utilized the web scraping techniques to  gather data on Child Mortality from the World Bank. This data is the basis for the analysis in your Shiny app.

2.  **Shiny Application**: It consists of Shiny app that utilizes the data
    obtained from the web scraping. The app should includes  visualization of child mortality across world through interactive maps, and it also has an interactive data table.
   

**Project Workflow:**

- **Data Acquisition**: Use of the `rvest` and `polite` packages to scrape data.
  
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and prepared data so that it is well-organized and ready for visualization.

- **Shiny App Development**: Used `shiny`, `shinydashboard`,`ggplotly`,  `DT`, and other R packages to create interactive visualizations and  tables. The app is user-friendly and informative as it provides insights into the Child Mortality data.
